# Efficient Study Platform

> *Motivation: I built this project because I wanted to learn a new web framework (Django)  and different kinds of tools and techniques related to full stack development. I chose the project topic guided by the wish of creating something that has a real life applicability and also that would help me.*

### Description
The purpose of the application is to provide an online environment for students that will help them in the study process.

Navigating through the app you will find a tasks management system, a place for creating flashcards, the possibility of editing your own user profile and sending friend requests and also, a section where you can connect with your friends and start live chatting. If you are the kind of person that likes to study for fixed and organised periods of time, the pomodoro timer that you will find in the study session section may help you.
